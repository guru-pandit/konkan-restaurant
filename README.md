### About Project:

This is my personal internship project of Front End Web Development at docogen.com

This Restaurant website is single page and fully responsive website. I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap4 to make this website. AOS (Animate on Scroll) library is used to to add effects on scrolling the webpage.

Bootstrap is popular and Open Source CSS framework which is used to developing responsive and mobile-first website
